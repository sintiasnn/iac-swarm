## üèÅ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To get started, install Moon globally [(see documentation)][moon-install] and ensure you have
`Docker >=20.10` and `Moon >=1.32` installed on your machine.

### Up and running

1. Setup the monorepo environment: `moon setup`
2. Create `.env` file or duplicate the `.env.example` file, then configure required variables.
3. Generate application secret key: `pnpm generate:key`
4. Run the database develoment server: `pnpm compose:up`
5. Launch the development servers: `moon run '#apps:dev'` or `moon :dev`

After all, it will simultaneously start the backend and website applications.

Strapi backend(cms) and website app will run simultaneously in development mode:

- Backend application will run at: <http://localhost:8000>
